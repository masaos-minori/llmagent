# Agent Inconsistencies and Known Issues

This file catalogs known bugs, spec conflicts, document inconsistencies, unimplemented
areas, and open questions in the agent layer (`agent/`, `shared/`).

Each entry format:
- **Type:** `Document inconsistency` / `Implementation bug` / `Undocumented` / `Needs confirmation` / `Open Question`
- **Impact scope:** Affected modules / behavior
- **Statement A / B:** Conflicting facts (when applicable)
- **Current safe interpretation:** What to assume when uncertain
- **Recommended action:** Fix or investigation needed
- **Notes for AI reference:** Guidance for AI reasoning about this issue

## Open Questions

### Session SQLite corruption recovery gap

- **Type:** Known Gap
- `/db recover` (compatibility alias) and `/db rag recover` target `rag.sqlite` only (via `RagMaintenanceService`)
- `/db session recover [backup-path]` now exists: calls `DbMaintenanceService.recover_session()` → `recover_corruption(backup_path, target="session")`
- Operator path: `/db session recover /path/to/backup.sqlite`

## Undocumented Areas

### UNDOC-02: Plugin tool return value convention not enforced at registration time

- **Type:** Addressed (runtime enforcement exists at call time)
- **Impact scope:** `shared/plugin_registry.py @register_tool`, `shared/tool_executor.py ToolExecutor.execute()`
- **Current state:** `ToolExecutor.execute()` validates the return value at call time: checks `isinstance(result_raw, tuple)`, `len >= 2`, `isinstance(output, str)`, `isinstance(is_error, bool)` — raises `ValueError` or `TypeError` on mismatch. No enforcement at `@register_tool` decoration time.
- **Current safe interpretation:** Return type errors surface on the first call, not at startup. Convention `tuple[str, bool]` is documented in `05_agent_11_extension-points.md`.
- **Notes for AI reference:** Plugin tools bypass MCP routing and TTL cache. A plugin with the same name as an MCP tool shadows the MCP tool.
