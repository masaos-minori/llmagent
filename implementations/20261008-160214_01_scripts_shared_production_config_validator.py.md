## Goal
Remove the validator from the shared package by moving it to the agent package with `git mv`, so the shared package no longer imports the agent package. (REQ-001 of the Plan)

## Scope
- Only this file's change as described below; behavior of the validator is unchanged.

## Assumptions
- The user chose to move the validator module into the agent package (not to inject its dependencies) and, for the shared documents, a one-line pointer to the agent configuration document.
- Procedures are applied in sequence number order; the module move (01) and test move (06) come first so later rows build on the new paths.

## Design decisions
- Mechanical path change only; no backward-compatibility re-export at the old path.

## Alternatives considered
- Injecting the validator's dependencies from the agent side: rejected by the user's choice.

## Implementation
### Target file
scripts/shared/production_config_validator.py

### Procedure
1. Confirm no code still imports the old path except the files listed in the Plan.
2. Run `git mv scripts/shared/production_config_validator.py scripts/agent/production_config_validator.py` (this row records the removal; procedure 02 records the new file).
3. Run the import-boundary check.

### Method
Mechanical edit or `git mv`; no change to function bodies or assertions.

### Details
The move keeps history. This document covers the old path; procedure 02 covers the new path and any docstring path change.

## Compatibility considerations
- No behavior change; the old path disappears, so every importer is updated in the same change.

## Security considerations
- None: no validation rule changes.

## Rollback considerations
- Revert the commit.

## Validation plan
- `PYTHONPATH=scripts uv run lint-imports` reports every contract kept; `ls scripts/shared/production_config_validator.py` fails.

## Completion criteria
- The old path no longer exists and the shared package imports nothing from the agent package.

## Out of scope
- Any change to validation rules and any file not listed in the Plan.
