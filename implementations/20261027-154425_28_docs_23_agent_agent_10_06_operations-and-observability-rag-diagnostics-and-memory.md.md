# Implementation Procedure: M single-occurrence key rename on `agent_10_06_operations-and-observability-rag-diagnostics-and-memory.md`

## Goal
Rename the standalone `rag_service_url` occurrence to `rag_query_service_url` (REQ-005, AC-5).

## Scope
- One occurrence rename: HttpAugment presence condition "(present when `rag_service_url` is configured)" (L48). No surrounding content changes.

## Assumptions
- Mechanical rename only: every edit is a whole-word substitution of `rag_service_url` to `rag_query_service_url`; no semantics, defaults, or reader logic change (Plan Design).
- `rag_pipeline_service_url` occurrences are a superset substring of the old key; every validation grep excludes it (`grep -v rag_pipeline_service_url`) so ingestion-path text is never touched (REQ-003).
- Rebase immediately before implementing: the sibling rag001 Plan procedures (implementations/20261027-131124_*) touch `tests/rag/test_rag_pipeline.py` and `tests/rag/test_augment_refiner.py`, and the rag002 Plan procedures (implementations/20261027-144351_*) touch `docs/21_rag/rag_05_01-configuration-reference.md` and `tests/rag/test_rag_pipeline.py`; edits are disjoint, whichever implements second rebases (Plan Dependencies).

## Design decisions
- Single-token substitution; docs pages are high-churn (Plan Risks), so rebase immediately before editing and re-verify the occurrence line numbers.

## Alternatives considered
- Keep an alias mapping `rag_service_url` -> `rag_query_service_url` — rejected: zero consumers exist (verified inventory), and an alias re-introduces the ambiguity the rename removes (Plan Design).
- Rename the ingestion key instead — rejected: it is live in `config/ingester.toml` and `/opt/llm/config/ingester.toml` (Plan Design).

## Implementation
### Target file
`docs/23_agent/agent_10_06_operations-and-observability-rag-diagnostics-and-memory.md`
### Procedure
1. Rename the verified occurrence.
2. Re-grep the page to confirm no further standalone occurrence.
### Method
Whole-word substitution of `rag_service_url` restricted to occurrences NOT part of `rag_pipeline_service_url` (the ingestion key is a superset substring — verify each match or use `grep -v rag_pipeline_service_url`), followed by the exhaustiveness grep.
### Details
- Domain: 23_agent. Part of the 8-page docs rename set.

## Compatibility considerations
- The rename is repo-internal: no repo or deployed config file references the old spelling (verified 2026-10-27 across `config/` and `/opt/llm/config/`), so no external consumer is affected (REQ-006, Plan Design).
- `rag_query_service_url` collides with no existing identifier; the only `rag_query*` names in the repo are the unrelated `rag_query_id` log context key and `rag_query_count` session stat (Plan Assumptions, verified).

## Security considerations
- No security surface change. With an unrecognized key the loader keeps the `None` default, which means "no HTTP delegation" — the fail-safe direction (Plan Design). `rag_auth_token` pairing semantics are unchanged.

## Rollback considerations
- Single atomic rename commit; rollback is `git revert` of that commit. No data migration, no config-file change, and no deployed-state change means revert is complete on its own.

## Validation plan
- `23_agent` documentation consistency check passes.
- `uv run python -c "import subprocess,sys; sys.exit(0 if not subprocess.run([ 'grep','-rn','rag_service_url','scripts/','tests/','docs/','--include=*.py','--include=*.md'], capture_output=True).stdout.replace(b'rag_pipeline_service_url', b'') else 1)"`-style exhaustiveness check: `grep -rn "rag_service_url" scripts/ tests/ docs/ | grep -v "rag_pipeline_service_url"` returns zero matches outside the single ADR rename note (AC-1, AC-5).

## Completion criteria
- Page names only `rag_query_service_url` for the query key.

## Out of Scope
- Renaming `rag_pipeline_service_url` or editing `config/ingester.toml` / `/opt/llm/config/ingester.toml` (REQ-003).
- Backward-compat alias or mapping for the old spelling (Plan Design: no consumer exists).
- Renaming `rag_auth_token` or any other RAG config field.
- Changes to which path reads which key, defaults, or delegation semantics.
