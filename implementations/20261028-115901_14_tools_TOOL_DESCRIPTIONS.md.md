# Procedure: update the two checker descriptions

## Goal

Describe node validation, body-rule errors and the marker rule in the two checker rows (Plan REQ-008).

## Scope

- Modify only `tools/TOOL_DESCRIPTIONS.md`.
- Documentation-only change; state current behavior only.

## Assumptions

- Rows 1 and 3 have landed.
- Overlap (compatible): `plans/20261028-094441_ebdlqunique007_enforce-dlq-redelivery-uniqueness.md` edits only the ADR-006 Implementation Notes, while this Plan edits ADR-006's Verification table. Any citation added by that Plan must resolve to an existing test node once the node validation of this Plan is in force.

## Design decisions

- Edit the named sentences after re-reading the current text; do not reflow surrounding paragraphs.

## Alternatives considered

N/A: lightweight row.

## Implementation

### Target file

`tools/TOOL_DESCRIPTIONS.md`

### Procedure

- In both tables (Index and detail), update the `check_adr_invariant_matrix.py` rows: cited `file.py::node` existence is verified by AST in the index and ADR bodies; empty evidence cells and body/index disagreements are errors.
- Update the `check_adr_reference.py` rows: matrix-named `scripts/*.py` files must carry a `# ADR-NNN` comment marker; the checker fails when the matrix yields no references.
- Run `uv run python tools/check_tool_descriptions_sync.py` afterwards.

### Method

Targeted sentence edits after re-reading the current file state.

### Details

- No tool is added or removed, so the module count and file names stay unchanged.

## Compatibility considerations

N/A: documentation-only.

## Security considerations

N/A: documentation-only.

## Rollback considerations

N/A: revert the commit.

## Validation plan

| Step | Command | Expected outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `uv run python tools/check_docs_quality.py`; `uv run python tools/check_docs_structure.py`; `uv run python tools/check_docs_content_policy.py --strict`; `uv run python tools/check_docs_japanese.py`; `uv run python tools/check_docs_consistency.py --domain governance` | No finding |

## Completion criteria

- The document states the behavior described in Details.
- All listed documentation checkers report no finding.

## Out of Scope

- Every other document.
- Code changes.
