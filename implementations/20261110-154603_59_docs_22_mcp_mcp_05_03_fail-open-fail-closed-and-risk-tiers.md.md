## Goal
State fail-closed defaults for the safety lists and keep `path_denylist` as the single documented fail-open exception (REQ-008).

## Scope
**Release unit**: N/A: not part of a release unit

## Assumptions
- Line numbers were read on 2026-11-10 before the code phases; re-locate them with `rg` if the file changed. Strict-only startup: tool-definition mismatch and routing drift are always FATAL with no toggle; empty `allowed_tools` denies every tool (also after reload); empty `allowed_root` and empty `protected_branches` (git, github) are rejected at config load; empty `path_denylist` stays permitted as a registered ADR-004 exception; `security_profile`/`SecurityProfile` no longer exist.
- The document is edited in Phase 6, after the code phases, so it describes the final behavior.

## Design decisions
- Describe behavior only; do not copy concrete config values (`skills/DESIGN.md` Docs content policy).
- English only (`skills/DESIGN.md` Output language).

## Alternatives considered
N/A: documentation-only row; the wording follows the Plan's settled behavior.

## Implementation
### Target file
`docs/22_mcp/mcp_05_03_fail-open-fail-closed-and-risk-tiers.md`
### Procedure
1. Lines 31-32 (summary table): keep the `path_denylist` row as fail-open (registered ADR-004 exception, rationale pending); change the `protected_branches` row to fail-closed at load (empty is rejected, the server does not start).
2. Lines 48-49 (posture table): `protected_branches` row no longer reports `not_applicable` when empty (an empty value cannot load); keep `path_denylist` as `not_applicable` when empty.
3. Lines 51 and 53: adjust the fail-open wording so that only `path_denylist` is a fail-open setting; add that an empty Agent `allowed_tools` denies every tool and an empty `allowed_root` is a load error.
4. Line 85: remove the 'strict-key' item from the list of what `ProductionConfigValidator.validate()` integrates (the strict keys no longer exist).
### Method
- Locate each statement with `rg -n 'tool_definitions_strict|routing_drift_strict|security_profile|SecurityProfile|accept_all_for_tests|list_tools|allowed_tools|allowed_root|protected_branches|path_denylist|fail-open' docs/22_mcp/mcp_05_03_fail-open-fail-closed-and-risk-tiers.md` and read the surrounding lines before editing.
### Details
- Target behavior to state: Strict-only startup: tool-definition mismatch and routing drift are always FATAL with no toggle; empty `allowed_tools` denies every tool (also after reload); empty `allowed_root` and empty `protected_branches` (git, github) are rejected at config load; empty `path_denylist` stays permitted as a registered ADR-004 exception; `security_profile`/`SecurityProfile` no longer exist.
- After the edit, `rg -n 'security_profile|SecurityProfile|accept_all_for_tests|list_tools_with_server_key' docs/22_mcp/mcp_05_03_fail-open-fail-closed-and-risk-tiers.md` returns nothing (AC-07, AC-05, AC-06).

## Compatibility considerations
N/A: documentation only; no code or config behavior changes in this row.

## Security considerations
N/A: documentation only; the text must not weaken the described fail-closed behavior.

## Rollback considerations
N/A: revert the commit.

## Validation plan
- Run `uv run python tools/check_docs_quality.py`, `uv run python tools/check_docs_structure.py docs/22_mcp/mcp_05_03_fail-open-fail-closed-and-risk-tiers.md`, `uv run python tools/check_docs_content_policy.py --strict`, `uv run python tools/check_docs_japanese.py`, `uv run python tools/check_docs_consistency.py --domain mcp`.

## Completion criteria
- Every listed statement is changed, the checkers above pass, and no removed name remains in the file.

## Out of Scope
- Renaming `mcp_06_09_startup-validation-behavior-tool_definitions_strict.md`; any file other than the target; writing the ADR-004 rationale text (maintainer, UNK-01).
