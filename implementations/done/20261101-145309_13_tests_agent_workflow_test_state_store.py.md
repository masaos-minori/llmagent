## Goal

Update `tests/agent/workflow/test_state_store.py` recovery mocks/assertions for the atomic attempt+task recovery (REQ-006, REQ-011 / AC-7).

## Scope

- The mocked recovery suite (`test_state_store.py:13-233`: mocks `find_stale_running_attempts`, asserts recovery counts) gains task-status assertions: each recovered attempt's owning `running` task becomes `failed`; an already-terminal owner is untouched.

## Assumptions

- Plan `plans/20261030-114041_wfrecovery001_workflow-recovery-state-machine.md` is Frozen; its 26-row `Implementation Target Files` table is the canonical scope and every target of this procedure is a row of that table.
- All baseline cites below were re-verified against branch `master` commit `384eb72` on 2026-11-01.
- Canonical semantics come from the Plan REQs (Plan `:41-52`): REQ-001 matrix `pending->{running,halted}`, `running->{completed,failed,halted}`, `failed->{running}`, `completed->failed` transitional, `halted` terminal; exactly three typed errors in `scripts/agent/workflow/errors.py`; `processed_events` as the completed-stage ledger (Plan UNK-02 default); recovery atomically fails the stale attempt and its owning `running` task (Plan UNK-03); claim accepts `pending` or `failed` only (Plan UNK-01).
- Landing-order dependency (Plan UNK-05): the wftaskapi001 procedures (`implementations/20261101-140834_*`, plan `plans/done/20261030-113553_wftaskapi001_consolidate-task-persistence.md`) are generated but Pending; the shared migration ledger code is fixed at landing time.
- The suite mocks `SQLiteHelper` calls; assertions pin the per-attempt transaction shape (attempt UPDATE then task UPDATE before commit).

## Design decisions

- Count semantics: `recover_stale_attempts` return value keeps counting transitioned attempts; task-side transitions are asserted separately.

## Alternatives considered

- Porting all recovery coverage to raw-SQL integration tests (row 17): rejected — this file's mock style is the existing pattern the ADR test table cites.

## Implementation
### Target file
`tests/agent/workflow/test_state_store.py`

### Procedure
1. Extend the existing recovery test cases with `tasks` status assertions.
2. Add a repeated-recovery case (second call returns 0 and changes nothing).

### Method
Direct edit; additive assertions plus one new case.

### Details
- Mock call recording must expect the added conditional task UPDATE (`AND status='running'`).

## Compatibility considerations

- ADR citation row is updated by row 23.

## Security considerations

- Status/attempt values written to SQL come only from the `models.py` enums, never from caller strings; all state SQL stays parameter-bound.

## Rollback considerations

- Revert with row 06.

## Validation plan

- `uv run pytest tests/agent/workflow/test_state_store.py -v`; fails pre-change (REQ-011).

## Completion criteria

- Recovery tests prove atomicity, owner-conditionality, and idempotent repeats (AC-7).

## Out of Scope

- Concurrency or crash scenarios.

## Implementation Result (2026-11-03: superseded by upstream)

This wfrecovery001 procedure implemented an attempt-number-based recovery state
machine. Upstream (`origin/master`) superseded this design with a lease-based
stale-attempt recovery (wflease001, AC-2/AC-4/AC-5/AC-7). The batch was
therefore NOT merged into `origin/master`.

- **Decision (2026-11-03):** full supersession. Every one of the ~32 code files
  the batch touched was rewritten or replaced by upstream (lease columns on
  `attempts`, a `disable_foreign_keys` migration-runner rebuild, fail-closed
  tool audit, schema manifest bumped to workflow version 1.4.0). No substantive
  delta survives.
- **Action:** the 3-way merge (`git merge --no-commit backup-batch` onto branch
  `rederive` from `origin/master`) was aborted (`git merge --abort`), returning
  to a clean `origin/master` at `7d6744fd`.
- **Residual:** `attempt_number` / `CHECK` are entangled with upstream's
  lease/local-retry design and cannot be integrated as a clean, bounded
  addition; reintroducing them would fight the lease architecture.
- **Outcome:** divergent code is not integrated. The batch remains on
  `backup-batch` as a superseded historical record. All 26 procedures were
  executed and marked Completed on `backup-batch`; this note records the
  supersession.
