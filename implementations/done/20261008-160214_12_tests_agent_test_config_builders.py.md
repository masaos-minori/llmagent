## Goal
Update the patch target string that names the validator's module. (REQ-003 of the Plan)

## Scope
- Only this file's change as described below; behavior of the validator is unchanged.

## Assumptions
- The user chose to move the validator module into the agent package (not to inject its dependencies) and, for the shared documents, a one-line pointer to the agent configuration document.
- Procedures are applied in sequence number order; the module move (01) and test move (06) come first so later rows build on the new paths.

## Design decisions
- Mechanical path change only; no backward-compatibility re-export at the old path.

## Alternatives considered
- Injecting the validator's dependencies from the agent side: rejected by the user's choice.

## Implementation
### Target file
tests/agent/test_config_builders.py

### Procedure
1. Replace the dotted patch target with the agent-package dotted path.
2. Run the file.

### Method
Mechanical edit or `git mv`; no change to function bodies or assertions.

### Details
The patch target `shared.production_config_validator.ProductionConfigValidator.validate` becomes `agent.production_config_validator.ProductionConfigValidator.validate`; the patched object is the class attribute, so the patch is effective only if the config builder module imports from the same module.

## Compatibility considerations
- No behavior change; the old path disappears, so every importer is updated in the same change.

## Security considerations
- None: no validation rule changes.

## Rollback considerations
- Revert the commit.

## Validation plan
- `uv run ruff format` and `ruff check` on the file; `uv run pytest tests/agent/test_config_builders.py -q --timeout=60`.

## Completion criteria
- The patch target uses the agent path and the file passes.

## Out of scope
- Any change to validation rules and any file not listed in the Plan.
