## Goal

- scripts/eventbus/health_route.py — import check_db from db_conn (AC-002, REQ-002)

## Scope
**Release unit**: facade-cutover

- The Plan declares one unit covering Phases 1-2: the NACK signature tightening, every import migration, both facade deletions, and the checker patterns land in one commit; any remaining facade import would break suite collection before release (Plan Release unit row, 2026-11-07).

## Assumptions

- All line anchors re-verified 2026-11-07 at HEAD `1a13653e8` (no target-file changes since the Plan freeze at `1b2dded66`).

## Design decisions

- Single import-line replacement; the health check body is untouched.

## Alternatives considered

- A single multi-file commit without per-file validation: rejected — per-file sibling documents keep each file's grep gate and test run auditable.

## Implementation
### Target file
`scripts/eventbus/health_route.py`
### Procedure
1. Replace line 9:
   ```python
   from eventbus.db_conn import check_db
   ```
2. Leave the health check body unchanged.
### Method
REQ-002 / AC-002. `scripts/eventbus/health_route.py` imports `check_db` from the
`eventbus.db` facade at line 9. `check_db` lives in `eventbus.db_conn`.
### Details
Import lines only; assertions and fixtures unchanged.

## Compatibility considerations

- Sibling document ordering (Plan phase sequence):
  - Depends on: nothing (Phase 2 of the `facade-cutover` unit).
  - Blocks: sibling documents 02 (an importer that must be migrated before the facade is deleted).

## Security considerations

N/A: import-boundary change.

## Rollback considerations

- Reverting the single facade-cutover commit restores this file with every sibling change together; no persisted state is involved.

## Validation plan

- Command: `grep -n "eventbus.db\b" scripts/eventbus/health_route.py`
  Expected: no matches.
- Command: `uv run pytest tests/eventbus/test_eventbus_health.py -q`
  Expected: pass (the file exercises the health route and its DB lock usage).

## Completion criteria

- health_route has no facade import. (AC-002, REQ-002)

## Out of Scope

- Every other file in the Plan's Implementation Target Files table is covered by a sibling document of this set; see Compatibility considerations for the ordering this document depends on.
