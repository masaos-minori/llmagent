## Goal
- Drop the removed config keys from the fixture (REQ-003).

## Scope
**Release unit**: N/A: not part of a release unit

- In scope: this one file, Phase 3 of the Plan.
- Not in scope: any other file; a second file needed here is an additional-target discovery.
- Execution order follows the Plan's phases, not `seq`: Phases 1 and 2 are one release unit (HTTP path and identity gate: documents 01-08, 11, 15, 21, 25, 27, 59 with their companions); Phase 3 (configuration keys: documents 09, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 61 and the fixture tests 26, 30-33, 35, 37, 38, 40); Phase 4 (ADRs and documents: 18, 19, 41-58, 60).

## Assumptions
- Overlap with plan 004 (`config/agent.toml`, `scripts/agent/production_config_validator.py`, `tests/agent/test_production_config_validator.py`, ADR-004) and plan 006 (`adr_01_index.md`): different keys or sections (judged in the Plan); no contradiction on this file.
- The Plan's Step 3a corrections apply (removed-key rejection is implemented once in `RagConfigValidator`; the gate block of `RagPipeline.augment()` keeps recording `_last_corpus_generation`; `rag_pipeline_service_url` belongs to the ingester and stays).

## Design decisions
- Remove only what the delegation path alone uses; keep `compute_local_identity`, `CorpusIdentity`, `ensure_corpus_meta`, `compute_identity`, and the refiner.

## Alternatives considered
N/A: RAG is reached only through rag-pipeline-mcp over the common MCP transport (Issue Implementation Intent); no remote-delegation or fallback path remains.

## Implementation
### Target file
`tests/rag/test_rag_quality_regression.py`

### Procedure
1. Remove `rag_query_service_url` and `rag_auth_token` (the removed keys) from the config fixture or `SimpleNamespace`/stub class of this module.

### Method
- Targeted edits; remove imports left unused as `ruff` reports them.

### Details
- 2 hits for the removed keys (rg count).

## Compatibility considerations
N/A: test code only.

## Security considerations
N/A: test code only; no credentials involved.

## Rollback considerations
N/A: revert the commit.

## Validation plan
- `uv run pytest tests/rag/test_rag_quality_regression.py -v`.

## Completion criteria
- No removed key remains in the module.

## Out of Scope
- Editing any other file.
- Adding any new fallback or remote-delegation mechanism.
