## Goal
- Remove the fallback gate decision logic and keep `compute_local_identity` (REQ-002).

## Scope
**Release unit**: http-path-and-gate

- In scope: this one file, Phase 2 of the Plan.
- Not in scope: any other file; a second file needed here is an additional-target discovery.
- Execution order follows the Plan's phases, not `seq`: Phases 1 and 2 are one release unit (HTTP path and identity gate: documents 01-08, 11, 15, 21, 25, 27, 59 with their companions); Phase 3 (configuration keys: documents 09, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 61 and the fixture tests 26, 30-33, 35, 37, 38, 40); Phase 4 (ADRs and documents: 18, 19, 41-58, 60).

## Assumptions
- Overlap with plan 004 (`config/agent.toml`, `scripts/agent/production_config_validator.py`, `tests/agent/test_production_config_validator.py`, ADR-004) and plan 006 (`adr_01_index.md`): different keys or sections (judged in the Plan); no contradiction on this file.
- The Plan's Step 3a corrections apply (removed-key rejection is implemented once in `RagConfigValidator`; the gate block of `RagPipeline.augment()` keeps recording `_last_corpus_generation`; `rag_pipeline_service_url` belongs to the ingester and stays).

## Design decisions
- Remove only what the delegation path alone uses; keep `compute_local_identity`, `CorpusIdentity`, `ensure_corpus_meta`, `compute_identity`, and the refiner.

## Alternatives considered
N/A: RAG is reached only through rag-pipeline-mcp over the common MCP transport (Issue Implementation Intent); no remote-delegation or fallback path remains.

## Implementation
### Target file
`scripts/rag/identity_gate.py`

### Procedure
1. Delete `GateDecision`, `_identity_gate`, and `_safe_corpus_id`, and the now-unused `dataclass` import; update the module docstring to describe only `compute_local_identity`.
2. Keep `_META_TABLE` and `compute_local_identity` byte-for-byte (used by `rag_pipeline_server.py` for the identity view and by `RagPipeline.augment()` for the corpus-generation record).

### Method
- Targeted edits; remove imports left unused as `ruff` reports them.

### Details
- `compute_local_identity` is imported by `scripts/mcp_servers/rag_pipeline/rag_pipeline_server.py` (checked in Step 3a).

## Compatibility considerations
- The removal is intentional and has no shim (`tools/check_compat_shims.py`).

## Security considerations
- Removes an outbound-token path and an empty-token default; no authentication or authorization behavior of the MCP server changes.

## Rollback considerations
- Revert the phase's commit; Phases 1 and 2 are one release unit and revert together.

## Validation plan
- `uv run pytest tests/rag/test_identity_gate.py -v` (document 25).
- `uv run ruff check scripts/ tests/ tools/`, `uv run mypy --no-namespace-packages scripts/ tests/eventbus tools`, `PYTHONPATH=scripts uv run lint-imports`.

## Completion criteria
- Only `compute_local_identity` remains.

## Out of Scope
- Editing any other file.
- Adding any new fallback or remote-delegation mechanism.
