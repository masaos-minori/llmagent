## Goal
- Remove the three keys from the `RagConfig` contract (REQ-003).

## Scope
**Release unit**: N/A: not part of a release unit

- In scope: this one file, Phase 3 of the Plan.
- Not in scope: any other file; a second file needed here is an additional-target discovery.
- Execution order follows the Plan's phases, not `seq`: Phases 1 and 2 are one release unit (HTTP path and identity gate: documents 01-08, 11, 15, 21, 25, 27, 59 with their companions); Phase 3 (configuration keys: documents 09, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 61 and the fixture tests 26, 30-33, 35, 37, 38, 40); Phase 4 (ADRs and documents: 18, 19, 41-58, 60).

## Assumptions
- Overlap with plan 004 (`config/agent.toml`, `scripts/agent/production_config_validator.py`, `tests/agent/test_production_config_validator.py`, ADR-004) and plan 006 (`adr_01_index.md`): different keys or sections (judged in the Plan); no contradiction on this file.
- The Plan's Step 3a corrections apply (removed-key rejection is implemented once in `RagConfigValidator`; the gate block of `RagPipeline.augment()` keeps recording `_last_corpus_generation`; `rag_pipeline_service_url` belongs to the ingester and stays).

## Design decisions
- Remove only what the delegation path alone uses; keep `compute_local_identity`, `CorpusIdentity`, `ensure_corpus_meta`, `compute_identity`, and the refiner.

## Alternatives considered
N/A: RAG is reached only through rag-pipeline-mcp over the common MCP transport (Issue Implementation Intent); no remote-delegation or fallback path remains.

## Implementation
### Target file
`scripts/shared/types.py`

### Procedure
1. Delete `rag_query_service_url`, `rag_auth_token`, and `rag_identity_mismatch_policy` (and its comment) from the `RagConfig` Protocol; keep `rag_pipeline_service_url`.

### Method
- Targeted edits; remove imports left unused as `ruff` reports them.

### Details
- Implementations: `RagConfigImpl` (document 09) and the MCP adapter (document 14).

### Companion test files
- `tests/agent/test_rag_get_cfg.py`
  - Procedure: Drop `rag_query_service_url` and `rag_auth_token` from the config fixture.
  - Validation: `uv run pytest tests/agent/test_rag_get_cfg.py -v`

## Compatibility considerations
- The removal is intentional and has no shim (`tools/check_compat_shims.py`).

## Security considerations
- Removes an outbound-token path and an empty-token default; no authentication or authorization behavior of the MCP server changes.

## Rollback considerations
- Revert the phase's commit; Phases 1 and 2 are one release unit and revert together.

## Validation plan
- `uv run pytest tests/agent/test_rag_get_cfg.py tests/rag -v`.
- `uv run ruff check scripts/ tests/ tools/`, `uv run mypy --no-namespace-packages scripts/ tests/eventbus tools`, `PYTHONPATH=scripts uv run lint-imports`.

## Completion criteria
- The contract carries none of the three keys.

## Out of Scope
- Editing any other file.
- Adding any new fallback or remote-delegation mechanism.
